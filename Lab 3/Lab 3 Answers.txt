1. List the execution time of the weblog aggregation query for Hive, SparkSQL, and SparkSQL on Parquet.
Hive: 49.9 s
SparkSQL: 10.5 s
SparkSQL on Parquet: 2.9s

2. How many jobs does Hive launch? Does SparkSQL launch jobs?
Hive launches 2 jobs.
It's not too clear how many jobs SparkSQL launches.  But it seems like it just lauches one job to complete the query.

3. Write a query which joins weblogs_parquet to user_info and counts the top 5 locations. List the locations.
The top 5 locations are:
La Fayette
Leeds
Blountsville
Hamilton
