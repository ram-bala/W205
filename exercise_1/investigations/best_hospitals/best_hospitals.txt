Approach & Justification
The question we were investigating is: What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures?
I approached the question in two parts.
Part 1: What hospitals are models of high-quality care?

This is a complex question. High-quality care is a notion that is very accessible in concept, but extremely tricky to define quantitatively. The CMS website lists several broad categories under which hospitals performance can be evaluated - Mortality & Safety of care, Readmissions, Timeliness & Effectiveness of care and Efficient use of Medican Imaging.  There are several metrics under each of these categories that aim to provide a measure of how well each hospital is performing.  The CMS has compiled a methodology that accumulates all these metrics, compares each hospital's performance to a national average and creates a star rating for each hospital.   So the simplest way to determine the best hospitals is to use this star rating. 



As an alternative, I created my own metric to measure the quality of service provided at each hospital. To do this, i utilized all the measures that were available in the various data files.  I computed a national average (and standard deviation) for each of these metrics, and used that to standardize each metric at each hospital (essentially a z-score). Now, i could aggregate these z-scores at the individual hospital level to determine which hospitals have the best values.  There are a couple of adjustments that I had make because of nature of the data
Adjustment 1:  Not every measure was available at every hospital.  So, instead of looking at the sum of the z-scores at each hospital, i looked at the average z-score.  In addition, there were a few hospitals where only a handful of measures were available. In order to have some reliability in the methodology, i restricted this to only hospitals that have at least 20 different metrics being tracked.
Adjustment 2: For some metrics, a higher value means better performance, and for others a lower value means better performance.  In order to aggregate across all measures - i had to convert every measure to a scale where lower values always means better performance.  I did this by tagging each metric as either +1 (lower is better) or -1 (higher is better) and multiplying each measure by this value (so measures where higher meant better would be turned into  negative values). 


RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

Here are the results from the first approach (there are MANY 5-star hospitals, so listed below are just 10 of those 5-star hospitals).
