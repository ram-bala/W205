Q1: What is the difference between EBS and S3?
Ans: EBS (Elastic Block Storage) is a storage facility that acts like an
"external hard drive" to the compute facility that we instantiate. In contrast
S3 is a storage facility that is used for archiving data and storing backup
copies of data.  EBS is really useful when it is attached to a compute
facility (elastic compute - EC2); S3 is a standalone storage facility.


Q2: When would you consider a cloud infrastructure for your data science
tasks?

Ans: I would consider a cloud infrastructure when the compute and storage
needs are likely to scale (in a hard-to-predict fashion), when the needs are
sporadic (i.e. demand has many spikes), users are distributed geographically.  

Q3:What is the difference between Spot Instances and Reserved Instances?
Ans: Spot instances are EC2 instances that are available for use at that given
point in time.  Typically, these are unused EC2 instances and are available at
a discount (because they are a perishable good).  Availability of spot
instances is not guaranteed and as such not reliable for tasks that need to be
scheduled and completed at specific times.  Reserved Instance on the other
hand are EC2 instances that are configured and made available at specific
times during the day - so that they can be used to complete certain tasks that
are time/resource critical in a reliable fashion.  They tend to be more
expensive than spot instance pricing.

Q4: List the name of four software packages installed on the UCB AMI?
Ans: Python, emacs, streamparse, hadoop, perl, c++
